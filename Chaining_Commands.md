## Chaining with Semicolons

have to chain two commands together to get flag
executed commands: 

`/challenge/pwn;/challenge/college`

got flag: pwn.college{4ZgnZro24xWYbxfzyh1T1L09RCm.dVTN4QDL5EDM2czW}

## Your First Shell Script

This challenge required I write a shell script

first made a file using:

`touch bash.sh` (the challenge specified I had to use x.sh but I forgot and it doesn't appear to have made a difference)

then added commands to script file using

`nano bash.sh`

`/challenge/pwn`

`/challenge/college`

then ran file using 

`bash bash.sh`

and got the flag pwn.college{Q7BoLArSu4xuyx5GXr-2rqaYjYu.dFzN4QDL5EDM2czW}
