# flag leak

**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}`

The website had a filter which prevented the use of absolute file paths

We know the flag file was located in /usr/share/nginx/html/

So i made a relative path for the flag file using ../../../../flag.txt and obtained the flag

What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. Using relative paths

# cookies

**Flag:** `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}`

Challenge gave a website with the text "Welcome to my cookie search page. See how much I like different kinds of cookies!" and a bar to enter text. On entering some random text, it said "That doesn't appear to be a valid cookie." so i figured the challenge had something to do with the values of the cookies of the website

The website had just one cookie with the default value appeared to be set to -1

On changing the cookies to some values they each produced a different cookie name

with some trial and error of trying random values i ended up with the value of 18 which gave me the flag

# SOAP

**Flag:** `picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_e5f02dbf}`

This challenge presented me with a website with some buttons which when pressed displayed some info on the bottom of the page

I installed burpsuite to further analyze the requests being sent by the site

The hint for the challenge mentioned XML External Entity Injection, on doing some more research on this, i realised i could send a request to the site which would make it display the contents of a password file.

I did some more research and found an appropriate payload to send

I used the payload `<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>`

and got the flag on sending the request

Things I learnt from this challenge: 

1. Basic usage of burpsuite
2. how XML injections work

# More SQLi

**Flag:** `picoCTF{G3tting_5QL_1nJ3c7I0N_l1k3_y0u_sh0ulD_62aa7500}`

This challenge gave me an introduction to SQL injections

I had some idea about this before but this challenge helped understand it clearly.

Given to me was a login page which asked for password and username, as well as displayed the sql query whenever i entered anything.

I then used what i learnt about sql injections to enter the website

i used input password as `' or 1=1;--`

so effectively the sql quesry the server would run in order to check for the password i entered would be:

`SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = '' or 1=1;--' AND username = 'asdsa'`

this let me enter the site where i found a search bar and a display for a number of entries. The same technique i used previously did not appear to work this time around.

Using the hint given in the challenge, i did some googling and identified the database engine used in the website, SQLite. I googled the master tables present in the site to help me further.

as we can see, i could obtain the sql used to make each table and i hoped this would give some clues to find the flag.

after some trying with statements such as `' union select * from sqlite_master;--` i found that they didn't work.

after some thinking i remembered that the union function only worked when both the tables had the same number of columns, so i modified my query.

i used: `' union select sql,21312,21321 from sqlite_master;--`

this provided this information:

and as we can see, i found a table which had a column named flag, so i entered a query to display the it:

`' union select flag,2121,2121 from more_table;--`

this gave me the flag

Things I learnt from this challenge: 

1. SQL injections as well some SQLite

Other incorrect methods you tried:

- figuring out the appropriate query to enter took some trial and error
