# flag leak

**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}`

The website had a filter which prevented the use of absolute file paths

We know the flag file was located in /usr/share/nginx/html/

So i made a relative path for the flag file using ../../../../flag.txt and obtained the flag

What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. Using relative paths

# cookies

**Flag:** `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}`

Challenge gave a website with the text "Welcome to my cookie search page. See how much I like different kinds of cookies!" and a bar to enter text. On entering some random text, it said "That doesn't appear to be a valid cookie." so i figured the challenge had something to do with the values of the cookies of the website

The website had just one cookie with the default value appeared to be set to -1

On changing the cookies to some values they each produced a different cookie name

with some trial and error of trying random values i ended up with the value of 18 which gave me the flag

# SOAP

**Flag:** `picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_e5f02dbf}`

This challenge presented me with a website with some buttons which when pressed displayed some info on the bottom of the page

I installed burpsuite to further analyze the requests being sent by the site

The hint for the challenge mentioned XML External Entity Injection, on doing some more research on this, i realised i could send a request to the site which would make it display the contents of a password file.

I did some more research and found an appropriate payload to send

I used the payload `<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>`

and got the flag on sending the request

Things I learnt from this challenge: 

1. Basic usage of burpsuite
2. how XML injections work
