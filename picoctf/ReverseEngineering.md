# GDB baby step 1

**Flag:** `picoCTF{549698}`

This is something that is completely new to me so I started of by watching the reference videos given in the task phase pdf

I then installed IDA to see disassembled program

I opened up the given file in IDA and saw the mentioned register with the value it contained

converted the value from hexadecimal to decimal and got the flag

What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. Reading basic assembly code
2. Using IDA to dissassemble programs
