# buffer overflow  0

**Flag:** `picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}`

There was a problem in OASIS (the asteroid one) which followed the same principle so i had somewhat of an idea of what to do this time arround

I saw the C code and found the use of many buffers as well as the gets function


```
void vuln(char *input){
  char buf2[16];
  strcpy(buf2, input);
}

```
```

  fgets(flag,FLAGSIZE_MAX,f);
  signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler); // Set up signal handler

```
```
  printf("Input: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  char buf1[100];
  gets(buf1);
  vuln(buf1);
  printf("The program will exit now\n");
  return 0;
}
```

So the first thing i thought was to Input a large string and it worked

```
blue@BlueKnight:~/ctf/buffer overflow 0$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 56940
Input: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}
```

# format string  0

**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_63191ce6}`

This challenge felt a bit weird and i need to do a bit more research on the topic
I got a program along with its source code
On running it, it asked me to enter options from among those provided which i tried all of until one worked, (i checked the hints on the chall and one of them literally also was to just try all the options)

on the second part, one of the options included format specifiers in C

```
Please choose from the following burgers: Pe%to_Portobello, $outhwest_Burger, Cla%sic_Che%s%steak
```

I knew %s was the format specifier for string in C so i tried entering that one and i got the flag

After doing some research I think I have a better understanding of what happened
We passed a number of format specifiers into our input, but there wasn't any argument to back up the format specifier, so the function went up the stack and found something which fits.

Need to look up more into this

1. How format specifiers can be exploited
