## All that for a drop of blood
this challenge gave me a bit of trouble. After seeing the hint on the discord server i used the modheader extension and set a header User-Agent = OASISPlayer.
this finished the first part, next part required me to add the parameter 'name' with value Cryptonite
third part asked me to add another parameter with cryptonite's rank = 4
## Heads up, tails down
recieved a corrupted png file, which i opened up in a hex editor and saw the png magic bytes and ihdr weren't there
added both of these and uncorrupted the png
## I have been falling for 30 minutes!

## Stairway to Heaven
ran the file using wsl and got bunch of coloured blocks, copy pasted this into text file and found hexadecimal characters
decoded to get flag
## Git Gud
recived folder .git
used gitbash to check commit log and found flag
